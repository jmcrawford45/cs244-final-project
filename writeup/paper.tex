\begin{abstract}
    Server authenticity, privacy over communication lines, and integrity of transport level data are desirable for many popular applications such as web browsing, email, and Voice over IP. 
    The Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) provides these security properties between application servers and web browsers through various cryptographic primitives. 
    A typical connection over TLSv1.2 today is a multistep interactive process between server and client which includes an exchange of public key information, a negotiation on which ciphers to use for the resulting communication, and advertisement for support of a variety of TLS extensions. 
    Thus, establishing this secure communication line incurs an initial latency overhead in the form of multiple transport level handshake round trip times.

    \end{figure}
    
    As a performance optimization for the common case of bursty connections in frequent but short intervals, TLS supports extensions which allow a web browser to resume a previous connection with a server without completing a new handshake. However, these mechanisms trade off with an important security property of user traffic: perfect forward secrecy. In a perfect forward secret scheme, each separate server-client connection is encrypted using a unique session key. Immediately after the connection terminates, both parties are responsible for deleting the key. Once the ephemeral key has been deleted, the contents of this communication cannot be decrypted even in the event of server compromise. However, in an imperfect secret scheme, one party will maintain a temporary cache of session state including the session key to allow frequent reconnections to complete more quickly. By maintaining session state across connections, a client can resume subsequent connections without having to renegotiate ciphers and derive a new session key. The maximum lifetime of a session key is thus a tradeoff between privacy and reconnect latency in such a scheme.
